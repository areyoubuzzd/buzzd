# Buzzd App - Fixed Deployment Instructions

These instructions explain how to properly deploy the Buzzd Happy Hour App after fixing the deployment issues.

## What Was Fixed

The deployment was previously failing because:
1. The dual-server architecture wasn't properly configured for production
2. Database connection wasn't being reliably established in the production environment
3. The build process wasn't correctly generating deployable static assets

## How To Deploy

Follow these steps to deploy successfully:

### 1. Ensure Environment Variables

Make sure the following environment variables are set in your Replit deployment settings:
- `DATABASE_URL` - The connection string to your PostgreSQL database
- `NODE_ENV` - Should be set to "production"

### 2. Deploy Using the Simplified Server

The simplified deployment server (`deployment-server.js`) was created to:
- Connect to the database properly
- Serve static files from built assets
- Proxy API requests to the backend
- Handle routing for the single-page application

### 3. Deployment Steps

1. Go to the "Deployment" tab in the Replit interface
2. Make sure to use the following settings:
   - **Run command**: `node deployment-server.js`
   - **Environment**: Select "Production"
   - **Environment Variables**: Ensure DATABASE_URL is included
3. Click "Deploy"
4. Your app will be available at [https://happy-hour-hub-sandmanideastre.replit.app/](https://happy-hour-hub-sandmanideastre.replit.app/)

### 4. Verify Deployment

After deployment, verify that:
1. The home page loads with the list of restaurants
2. You can click on restaurants to see their details
3. The happy hour deals are displayed correctly
4. The API endpoints (like `/api/deals/collections/all`) return data

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Database Connection Errors**:
   - Verify the DATABASE_URL environment variable is correctly set
   - Check if the database is accessible from Replit's servers

2. **Missing Assets/Blank Page**:
   - Check the browser console for any 404 errors
   - Make sure the build process completed successfully

3. **API Issues**:
   - Test API endpoints directly (e.g., `/api/healthcheck`)
   - Check server logs for any backend errors

## Additional Information

- The deployment server will start on port 3000 by default
- It proxies all `/api/*` requests to an internal API server on port 5000
- Static files are served from the `dist` directory or `public` if available
- Client-side routing is handled by redirecting all routes to `index.html`

If you need to modify the deployment setup, edit the `deployment-server.js` file.
