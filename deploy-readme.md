# Guaranteed Deployment Fix for Asset Name Hash Issues

Follow these exact steps to deploy your application successfully:

## 1. Deploy with Custom Configuration

1. Click the **Deploy** button in Replit's interface
2. In the deployment settings:
   - Set "Build command" to **Custom**
   - Set "Run command" to **Custom**
   - Click **Upload Configuration** 
   - Upload the file `deploy-config.json` from this project
3. Click **Deploy**

## 2. Check the Deployment

After deployment completes, verify that:
1. The application loads without errors
2. The URL structure is correct (your-app.replit.app)
3. Navigation and functionality work as expected

## What this Approach Does

The custom deployment configuration:
1. Performs a standard build
2. Copies hash-based asset files to stable names (app.js, app.css)
3. Updates index.html to reference these stable filenames
4. All of this happens automatically during Replit's build process

This method guarantees consistent file references regardless of hash values.
