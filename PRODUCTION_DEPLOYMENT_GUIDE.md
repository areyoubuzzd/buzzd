# Production Deployment Guide for Buzzd App

## Current Deployment Setup
We've created an ultra-simple server approach that:

1. Runs the application server directly 
2. Handles proper routing and API proxying
3. Ensures database connection works correctly
4. Provides diagnostic endpoints to check server status

## Deployment Instructions

1. Go to the Replit Deployment tab
2. Add **DATABASE_URL** as a secret with your database connection string:
   ```
   postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_kXoGV2sIupc9@ep-mute-wave-a5t2c5zr.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
   ```
3. Click "Deploy"

## How It Works

Our ultra-simple-server.js:
1. Starts directly with `node ultra-simple-server.js`
2. Launches your main application server (`tsx server/index.ts`) on a separate port
3. Provides diagnostic endpoints for troubleshooting
4. Proxies all API requests to your main application
5. Serves a loading page for the frontend while the application server starts

## Testing the Deployment

After deploying, you can test these endpoints:
- `/api/servercheck` - Basic health check of the deployment server
- `/api/establishments` - If this works, your application is fully functioning

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the "Logs" tab in the Replit Deployment interface
2. Verify the DATABASE_URL secret is set correctly
3. Access the `/api/servercheck` endpoint to confirm server status

The ultra-simple approach ensures your application runs in production exactly as it does in preview, without any complex proxy or build configuration.
